# Application website.
This would be my first succesful programme in my short tenure. 
The website makes use of Flask to create the web application with HTML templates with inline CSS for styling.
The basic idea of the website is that it requires the user to input some personal information(Name, Email, the position of aplication, and age), just the most basic of information in an application form.
Now the website employs basic form validation and classification in that it ensure that no one below 18 years old or 80 years old may apply for a job.
It is common knowledge that the more experience one has in a certain field of expertise, the better they are at it and the more valued they are and are thus paid more.With this in mind I created a simple classification by having all the ages between 17 and 81 in age groups with different salaries that also differ with position for example a designer may earn more than a developer even if they are of the same age.
After every three submissions the totals of their salaries are displayed and also the information of all former applicants is shown.This reccurs so even the next three applicants will just be added to it and also displayed.
That is basically all there is to it. I do realize that it is very rudimentary in that it has no way of verifying whether the emails that are being input are actual emails and it also doesn't prevent resubmission and probably many other issues but despite all these, it is my first application and if i must say it turned out quite well.
